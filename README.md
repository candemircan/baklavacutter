# baklavacutter_lowsugar

An easy to setup cookiecutter template for my research projects. More lightweight version of [baklavacutter](https://github.com/candemircan/baklavacutter), which additionally involves some documentation setup with `mkdocs`.

Run the following command to create a new project:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:candemircan/baklavacutter_lowsugar
```
